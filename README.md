## Map Image
The image below is the image intended to be used with the project. Accessing the project works best when the map below is printed, but for an idea of what it looks like, the camera can be pointed at the image below disaplyed on a monitor. Please note that when viewing the project using the image below displayed using a monitor, the displayed data moves around and "wobbles", this does not happen when the image is printed.
